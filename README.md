# Python general
This is a repository with general Python exercises and tiny projects. </br>
You can also find here my solutions for problems from websites such as Codewars [https://www.codewars.com/], Leetcode [https://leetcode.com/] or Edabit [https://edabit.com/challenges] that I found pretty interesting.
